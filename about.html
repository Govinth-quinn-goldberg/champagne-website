        <h2><span style="color: rgb(194, 53, 53);">About us</span></h2>
        <p class="texts">Founded in 1947, our journey began with a single belief — that true champagne is more than a drink, it's an experience.<br><br>
        Born in the heart of tradition and refined through generations of craftsmanship, we have dedicated decades to perfecting the art of champagne making. Every bottle tells a story of patience, passion, and precision — from carefully selected grapes to slow, elegant fermentation.<br><br>
        We blend heritage with modern sophistication, creating champagne that celebrates life's finest moments — the quiet victories, the grand celebrations, and everything in between.<br><br>
        Rooted in authenticity and driven by excellence, our champagne is crafted for those who appreciate depth, character, and timeless luxury.<br><br></p>
